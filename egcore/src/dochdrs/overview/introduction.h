This is an example to test a range of functionality and issues when using:
- CMAKE build system
- doxygen
- visual studio
- eclipse
- multiple platforms: Windows, Mac, BSD, Linux
- not currently supported: Cygwin; anything else not mentioned.

To get a reasonable idea while KISS, there are two libraries each with their own test programs.

@note:
The source is incidental to this purpose but is organised to seperate two conceptual audiences - app devs and library devs.
include/egcore is the public API for use the Application/program devs.
include/egcore/private is the (package) private API for use by library devs.
